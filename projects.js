"longDesc": "Redline Engine Sounds is a mobile car engine simulator developed for Android devices. The game lets players experience realistic engine, exhaust and car sounds from both classic and high-performance cars, including legendary models like the M5, Corvette, Mustang, Supra and GT-R. I worked on implementing manual gear throttle, brake and accelerator input, as well as authentic gauge behavior that reacts to player interaction. A built-in stopwatch allows users to race against their own best times and compare results with friends. My responsibilities included core gameplay logic, sound integration, UI flows, performance optimization for a wide range of Android devices, and preparing builds for release on Google Play.",
